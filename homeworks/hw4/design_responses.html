							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of incorporating accesibility awarness in design. Previously I had figured that to some extent designing for accesibility was important, but I didn't realize how many people were actually affected by impairments that websites could help adhere to. I similarly did not realize how simple it was to adjust certain designs to make it more accessible. Specifically, adding texture to graphs and metrics was very insightful for me.   </p>
