					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img src="assets/imgs/IMG_0104.jpg" /> </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> <img src="assets/imgs/IMG_0107.jpg" /> </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the Youtube website is to personalized provide entertainment. It is intended for a very general audience. The website accomplishes delivering personalized entertainment by having a strong recommendation videos and providing multiple ways for users to continually seeing videos pop up that they might be interested in.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I focused on the subscription page and one thing I wanted to bring back in the desing process was being able to see the channels one is subscribed to. This provides more cohesion in the page for the user. I accomplished this by adding a scrolling line of channels for the user to refer to.  </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
