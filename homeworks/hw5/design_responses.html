                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> In this article, I learned a lot about color coordination. Specifically, there were many examples where they would use a color in the search bar and combine that with that same color in the answers. Similarly, color coordination in graphics was also prevalent. It seems that coordinating colors just is a nice visual element to include.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I like that all the images in the article were interactive. Having interactive elements was helpful to see how many features worked. The interactive elements also help with showing how visual design can come in many different facets. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite interaction was the easygrow.io app interaction. Firstly, there were some small elements that just made the swiping very clean - such as having the image in the right border of the image. Secondly, I really enjoyed the display of metrics and the highlight on the most important metrics. The change in background color per vegetable was also a nice touch. Similarly, the pull up bar for more in detal graphics was super interesting to me. I really enjoyed that it met the purpose of the graphic in providing more information, but it's not crowded in the main image. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> I would rate this article an 8. I really enjoyed looking through the interactions and learning mroe about different interactions and seeing how I could potentially bring certain interactions into my own designs.  </p>
